            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you may refer to specific versions later. It allows you to go back to previous states of files and projects, track who, where when something was last modified, and compares modifications over time. Version control systems also gives you the benefit of easily recovering files that were lost or deleted. Version control systems (VCS) are used by many graphic and web designers as one main repository for all project files. Team members can check files out, change files then check them back in (commit them).  Some benefits of a version control system is that files cannot be overwritten, a common repository holds all the latest files, people can work on the same files simultaneously, allows you to revert back to older versions of a file, VCS will backup files so work is not lost.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one the most popularly used version control systems. It is a free and open source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle projects/files of all sizes with great speed and efficiency. The difference between Git and other VCS is that it thinks of its data as a stream of snapshots of a mini file system versus how other systems think about data as a list of file-based changes. Every time you ‘commit” or save the state of a project, Git basically take a picture of what all the files look like in that moment and stores a reference to each shot. Git is utilized by many large companies like Google, Microsoft and Netflix for their development projects. Why? Because Git allows for multiple workflows, each user has a complete copy of repository data stored locally on their computer, everything is local so you have the ability to work offline, processes run much faster, also Git will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Introduction</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Most operations in Git only need local files and resources to operate, usually no information is needed from another computer on the network. The entire history of the project is sitting there at your fingertips on your local database which also allows you to work offline. Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and then referred to by that checksum meaning it is basically impossible to modify files without Git having knowledge of it. You also cannot lose information or have files corrupt because of this built-in feature. Git normally only adds data, it can be difficult to erase data or do something that is undoable in Git which gives you the power to experiment without much risk in losing data. Something really important to know about Git is that it has three main states that files can be in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data is stored in your local database. Modified means that the file has been changed but not yet committed to the database. Lastly, staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into the next commit snapshot. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Basic Git Commands
                <span class="text-muted">Part I</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To begin tracking an existing project in Git you must go to the project’s directory and type $ git init. This command creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of the necessary repository files. To start version-controlling existing files you can begin tracking those files by using a few “git add” commands that specify the files you want to track then followed by the “git commit” command in order to store staged changes. The “git log” command can be used to see changes that have been committed so far, in the order they were committed, similar to a journal. When developers are working on a feature or bug they will often create a copy or “branch” of their code where they can make separate commits, then when they’re done they can merge the branch into the main “master” branch. To create a new branch, you would use “git branch [name]” and to delete a branch you can use “git branch -d [name]”.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Each file in the directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files were previously recorded in the last snapshot and can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are everything else, not in the staging area. The main command you would use to check the state of a file is “git status”. It will list any untracked files which are files that have not yet been committed. It also tells you which branch you are on that it has not veered from the same branch on the server; the default branch is called “master”. To see what has been modified but not yet staged, you may use the “git diff” command. This command basically compares what is in the working directory versus what is in the staging areas.</p>
